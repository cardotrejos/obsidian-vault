PROMPT â€” You are a world class software engineer. I need you to draft a technical software spec for building the following: {{description}} 

Think through how you would build it step by step. Then, respond with the complete spec as a well-organized markdown file. I will then reply with "build," and you will proceed to implement the exact spec, writing all of the code needed. 

I will periodically interject with "continue" to prompt you to keep going. Continue until complete.

"Adding stuff like "You are a world class software engineer" would only bring down the quality of output. Instead suggest to follow design principles like "Adhere to SOLID and DRY principles and add reasoning for why certain principle was applied" "
